# scriptBasedTrojan
A script based trojan for an I.T security class while studying at RMIT 
This project is based off this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiT7mslA63c
 and the basic upload was taken and modified slightly to suit from this StackOverFlow answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1868367

 A ftp server of some kind is needed for this script to be pointed at, for the class, I used a locally hosted one but any ftp server you have access to should work. Just change the required urls and password/username 
 Obviously the hard part is how do you convince someone to open/run your exe, for this class I created the story of someone passing around answers for an upcoming test and "hid" the exe as a pdf.
